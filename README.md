Intro

This repo is a simple TODO list. It is much simplified from the original (and not working) I created during a technical challenge.

It uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and using the same layout and color scheme as the technical challenge. This application is sized for non-mobile devices.

Use
Add an item:
- To add an item, type a ToDo in the input field and click on the plus sign. 

Indicate an item is done:
- To indicate an item is done, click once on the listed item and a line with strike though it. 

Remove an item:
- To remove an item from the list, just double click on it. 

The site is deployed on Netlify. VIEW DEMO HERE!
